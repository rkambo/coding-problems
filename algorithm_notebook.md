## Trees

### Depth First Search

#### Iterative

1. Use a stack
2. While the stack is not empty, pop the last element from the stack and store the value in a variable (i.e current)
3. Print out the value of current (or store it in an array)
4. If current's right child exists, add it to the stack
5. If the current's left child exists, add it to the stack
